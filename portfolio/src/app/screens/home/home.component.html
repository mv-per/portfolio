        This was me back in 2014...
      </h2>

      <p>This picture was taken in the chemical engineering labs at the University of Nevada, campus Reno. It was at this time I knew I wanted to help solve people's problems thorugh inovative solutions</p>

      <p>
        I began my career in chemical engineering, where I spent several years conducting in-depth research and exploring innovative solutions. During this time, I realized the immense potential of automation in streamlining processes
        and optimizing efficiency. It was this realization that sparked my curiosity and set me on a path to dive into the world of programming.
